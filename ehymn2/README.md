predefine buttons for gloria, i belive, our father











no wifi in chapel so school network is out of the question
start a blog
make it something I can easily expand beyond pau
     make it in such a way that you can easily add predefined buttons that can play certain songs like our father, gloria, I belive



4 textbox for hymn 1-4
1 send button
domain name
//check if printing to serial will affect mp3 player
// use normal webserver
//put the webserver code in a separate file
// add ota
// two webpages input and controls
//create button for specific hymns

do later
create a list with all they hymns and cateroized them and add a button to preview the song the song
  the list should be on the same page as the form, but it should be it own entity,it should be able to scroll without moving the whole page
